1. Analytical problem solving with code
2. Technical communication ( Can i implement your approach just from your explanation )
3. Engineering best practices and approach ( Debugging, code structure, patience and reference to documentation )
4. Non â€“ technical communication ( Empathetic and thoughtful communication )
5. Languange and Computer Science experience

Please note, the most important is just the top two. The rest are, but wont weigh as much as number 1 and 2.
